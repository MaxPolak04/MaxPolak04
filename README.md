# Maksymilian Polak

👨‍💻 I'm a computer science student at Collegium Da Vinci, currently building my developer portfolio and actively looking for growth opportunities in IT — internships, entry-level jobs, or freelance work.  
🚀 I'm passionate about backend and web development, and recently I've started exploring blockchain development to see if it's the right path for me.  
❤️ I'm a big fan of open-source projects and deeply value their mission and community-driven spirit.
